    <h3>Physics</h3>
    <h4 id="bio">PHYS 170/171</h4>
    <p>This lecture is the equivalent of PHYS 180, but it is oriented toward students interested in the biological sciences.  Essentially, the same topics are taught, but the physics is applied to biology.</p>
    <h4 id="180">PHYS 180/181</h4>
    <p>This course is generally more difficult and time consuming than the corresponding lab course.  There are two midterms and a final exam for each semester-long segment.  There are weekly problem sets that are designed to challenge students' critical thinking skills, but there are many course-oriented resources and office hours.  PHYS 180/181 is supposed to be taken after or concurrently with Math 115, as the course is calculus-based.  No prior physics knowledge is required to enroll in the lecture.</p>
    <h4 id="labs">Labs</h4>
    <p>Phys 165L goes hand in hand with University Physics and there is some overlap with the content.  The way that this lab is structures is that each lab focuses on a different physics concept and you take weekly quizzes on important formulae.  You do not need prior physics experience to take this class. Phys 165L has a midterm, which is a lab practical, and a final lab practical.  Each week, you will be writing a one page report, where the ultimate goal is to connect the lab to real life situations.  The second semester of this lab has a very similar structure to the first semester, except that there is no longer a midterm practical.</p>
    <h4 id="tips">Tips</h4>
    <p>~ Go to office hours as much as possible.</p>
    <p>~ Start the problem sets as soon as they're assigned.</p>
