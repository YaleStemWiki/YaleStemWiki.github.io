    <h3>Physics</h3>
    <h4 id="bio">PHYS 170/171</h4>
    <h4 id="180">PHYS 180/181</h4>
    <p>This course is generally more difficult and time consuming than the corresponding lab course.  There are two midterms and a final exam for each semester-long segment.  There are weekly problem sets that are designed to challenge students' critical thinking skills, but there are many course-oriented resources and office hours.  PHYS 180/181 is supposed to be taken after or concurrently with Math 115, as the course is calculus-based.  No prior physics knowledge is required to enroll in the lecture.</p>

    <p>~ Go to office hours as much as possible.</p>
    <p>~ Start the problem sets as soon as they're assigned.</p>
