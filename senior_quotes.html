        <h3>Margo Feuer, Chemistry</h3>

        <p>Hi! My name is Margo Feuer, TC '20. I am a chemistry major, and have enjoyed my time in the department. Some reflections/advice: I started doing research as a sophomore, which worked out well for me! Especially if you can work in a lab that doesn't overwork you, starting early is a great way to get experience! Don't be afraid to switch labs if it's not working out at one! It's okay, you'll still graduate! Working with a female grad student was a good fit for me, perhaps that is something to arrange for you, too. Doing research in the summers is a good way to see if grad school is something you are interested in--its really different than working between classes during the semester. NSF-funded Research Experience for Undergraduates are a good place to look for all STEM-fields. Good luck!</p>

        <p>If I learned anything from STEM at Yale, it's that it counts to have people on your side. Having mentors who believed in me and were invested in my success was vital. Between sophomore and junior year, I found a couple of professors who knew me well because I incessantly showed up to their office hours. They encouraged me on the days I felt like I may not be cut out, or that I was putting in twice the work to keep up. They led me to opportunities I would have never gone for and showed me that there are professors here who want to see their students succeed. Along the same lines, I would never advise anybody to try to finish a problem set on their own (unless collaboration isn't allowed). At some point, I was psetting alone and struggling and wondering how everybody else in the class was getting all of this done on their own. As it turns out, they weren't. Working in a group not only helped me remember concepts and held me accountable, but it also made me feel supported.</p>

        <h3>Sanelma Heinonen, Math</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>Hi, my name is Sanelma Heinonen and I'm graduating this year as a math major from Yale. Being a math major isn't easy, in fact, it is one of the hardest things I have ever done and there were definitely moments when I came close to giving up because I thought I wasn't smart enough for these courses. The secret to surviving is to realize that the courses and the problem sets are hard for everyone, not just for you. They are not meant to be easy! Force yourself not to be shy: go to office hours, make friends in your courses, struggle together. I have found the community to be very welcoming towards those who reach out for it, and this makes such a big difference.</p>

        <h3>Pamela Banner, Mechanical Engineering</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>Reflecting on my four years at Yale and the years before that when studying engineering first became a thought in my mind, the lesson I have learned time an time again--forcibly and voluntarily!--has been to ask for help when I need it. At least for me personally, part of the hesitation or fear was pride and part related to others' perceptions of me: would they feel it was expected, etc. It's hard not to think those things when you are one of a few women in the classroom or underrepresented for any reason. What it's always led to for me is reflection, though. What am I trying to understand here? Why does it matter to me? When I have answered those questions, to some extent, I find someone to help. And at Yale, I'd say that's our biggest blessing. There's always someone there. Sometimes that roadblock is simple like a pset question about which you can finally reach out to that acquaintance, or muster the confidence to walk into packed or dead-empty office hours (both can be intimidating). Sometimes they are harder, and answering the why in particular becomes harder to articulate. You'll find people at Yale who will help talk you through those too. You have to reach out to them though, especially if you have a why and you start to doubt it or your ability to reach it. This is all super general, and for that I apologize, but the single truest thing about my experience in STEM so far is it's inextricably tied to the upperclassmen, underclassmen, grad students and teachers I've met and learned from along the way.</p>
