          <p>Hi! My name is Margo Feuer, TC '20. I am a chemistry major, and have enjoyed my time in the department. Some reflections/advice: I started doing research as a sophomore, which worked out well for me! Especially if you can work in a lab that doesn't overwork you, starting early is a great way to get experience! Don't be afraid to switch labs if it's not working out at one! It's okay, you'll still graduate! Working with a female grad student was a good fit for me, perhaps that is something to arrange for you, too. Doing research in the summers is a good way to see if grad school is something you are interested in--its really different than working between classes during the semester. NSF-funded Research Experience for Undergraduates are a good place to look for all STEM-fields. Good luck!</p>

          <p>Don't be afraid, of the future, of academics, of failure, of uncertainty, of hatred, or of anything else. Don't submit to the stresses of life; I know that this is way easier said than done, but it's so important if you're going to overcome the many challenges coming your way, not only because of the field you've chosen but also, unfortunately, because of unjust societal imbalances that disadvantage certain groups. I urge you to find lifelines that can help you fight against the stresses of life, remind you of why you're on this path, and help you move forward; for me it has been God and my Christian community, especially my Christian friends who are pre-med science majors like me. And remember, when you prevail in the end, please be that lifeline and mentor to others, so that we can continue to break this twisted system and move toward a more equitable society, where anyone can be whoever they were meant to be without being held back. I believe in you.</p>

          <p>If I learned anything from STEM at Yale, it's that it counts to have people on your side. Having mentors who believed in me and were invested in my success was vital. Between sophomore and junior year, I found a couple of professors who knew me well because I incessantly showed up to their office hours. They encouraged me on the days I felt like I may not be cut out, or that I was putting in twice the work to keep up. They led me to opportunities I would have never gone for and showed me that there are professors here who want to see their students succeed. Along the same lines, I would never advise anybody to try to finish a problem set on their own (unless collaboration isn't allowed). At some point, I was psetting alone and struggling and wondering how everybody else in the class was getting all of this done on their own. As it turns out, they weren't. Working in a group not only helped me remember concepts and held me accountable, but it also made me feel supported.</p>

          <p>Hi, my name is Sanelma Heinonen and I'm graduating this year as a math major from Yale. Being a math major isn't easy, in fact, it is one of the hardest things I have ever done and there were definitely moments when I came close to giving up because I thought I wasn't smart enough for these courses. The secret to surviving is to realize that the courses and the problem sets are hard for everyone, not just for you. They are not meant to be easy! Force yourself not to be shy: go to office hours, make friends in your courses, struggle together. I have found the community to be very welcoming towards those who reach out for it, and this makes such a big difference.</p>

            <p>Mechanical Engineering</p></h3>
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          <p>Reflecting on my four years at Yale and the years before that when studying engineering first became a thought in my mind, the lesson I have learned time an time again--forcibly and voluntarily!--has been to ask for help when I need it. At least for me personally, part of the hesitation or fear was pride and part related to others' perceptions of me: would they feel it was expected, etc. It's hard not to think those things when you are one of a few women in the classroom or underrepresented for any reason. What it's always led to for me is reflection, though. What am I trying to understand here? Why does it matter to me? When I have answered those questions, to some extent, I find someone to help. And at Yale, I'd say that's our biggest blessing. There's always someone there. Sometimes that roadblock is simple like a pset question about which you can finally reach out to that acquaintance, or muster the confidence to walk into packed or dead-empty office hours (both can be intimidating). Sometimes they are harder, and answering the why in particular becomes harder to articulate. You'll find people at Yale who will help talk you through those too. You have to reach out to them though, especially if you have a 'why' and you start to doubt it or your ability to reach it. This is all super general, and for that I apologize, but the single truest thing about my experience in STEM so far is it's inextricably tied to the upperclassmen, underclassmen, grad students and teachers I've met and learned from along the way.</p>

          <p>First of all, congrats and good luck if you’re out there planning to pursue a STEM degree at Yale (or anywhere else). In my experience, it can get really hard, and I hope these small pieces of advice will help in some way. 1) Make friends in your classes. Maybe this is obvious, but after trying to do math alone for some time, I can honestly say it is easier, and much more fun, if you have a group of friends to work with. If you have to spend hours doing psets, don’t do it alone. 2) Go to office hours!! Treat them as an extension of class, and get your questions answered. 3) Get to know your STEM professors. Humanities people do it ALL THE TIME, and although it’s sometimes harder with STEM classes because we aren’t going to sit there and talk about politics or philosophy or whatever, it’s completely worth it. Ask them about their research (and then be prepared to sit there and understand nothing), or just bring questions from class. It took me 4 years, but the friendship I have with my thesis advisor has made math so much more fun, and also been really valuable for post-grad opportunities. 4) Know that you are smart, capable, and there for a reason! When you look around the classroom, remember that you have as much to add to the conversation as anyone else.</p>

        <div class="right">
          <p>When I first got to Yale, I was a bit nervous about my decision to major in MCDB. I knew I would have a lot of requirements to fulfill and that many of my classes would be challenging. However, instead of giving up on my dream and trying to find an easier path, I decided to find mentors within my major who could help me. I had people walk me through the major so I would know how to balance my schedule over my four years. Still, the most helpful thing for me during my 4 years at Yale were the friends I made within my major. We took classes together, studied together, and hung out as friends too. I found a supportive family within my major and that was the best thing I could’ve done for myself. It is okay to work alone, but it is important to know when to ask for help. These friends I made will last a lifetime and they made my MCDB journey amazing as well.</p>
