    <h3>Computer Science</h3>
    <h4 id="50">CS 50</h4>
    <p>
      Co-taught with Harvard University, this is a CS class for those with little to no 
      programming experience. This is not designed for CS majors, however, it serves as a 
      good introduction to programming if you don't feel comfortable diving into CPSC 112.
    </p>
    <h4 id="112">CPSC 112</h4>
    <p>
      Introductory programming course for those who are intending to take the CS major
      and have little to no programming experience.
    </p>
    <h4 id="201">CPSC 201</h4>
    <p>
      Introduction to computer science with those who have some experience with programming. No
      specific language requirements are needed for this class other than understanding programming 
      logic as a whole. Class is taught in Racket (similar to LISP/Scheme) which may seem unconventional, 
      however, the main focus of this class is on understanding methods of recursion and functional programming
      rather than object oriented.
    </p>
    <h4 id="223">CPSC 223</h4>
    <p>
      Introduction to algorithms and data structures in C. This class can be difficult when compared to 
      CS
