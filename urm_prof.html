He did postdoctoral training at National Institutes of Health, University of Valencia in Spain, and University of Maryland-College Park, before joining Yale’s Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department in 2001. His service to the profession includes Chair of the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) Division on Evolutionary and Genomic Microbiology, as well as membership on the National Science Foundation’s Biological Sciences Advisory Committee, ASM Committee on Minority Education, and multiple National Research Council advisory committees. Dr. Turner was elected Fellow of the National Academy of Sciences, Fellow of the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences, Fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology, Councilor of the American Genetic Association, Chair of the Gordon Research Conference on Microbial Population Biology, and Chair of the CNRS Jacques Monod Conference on Viral Emergence. He chaired the Watkins Graduate Research Fellowship award committee for ASM, and received the E.E. Just Endowed Research Fellowship and William Townsend Porter Award from Marine Biological Laboratory, and fellowships from Woodrow Wilson Foundation, NSF, NIH and HHMI. Dr. Turner has served as Director of Graduate Studies and as Chair of the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department at Yale, as well as Yale’s Interim Dean of Science and Chair of the Biological Sciences Advisory and Tenure Promotion Committees.</p><a href="mailto:paul.turner@yale.edu">Email</a>

            <h3>Andrea Gloria-Soria</h3>
            <p>Andrea Gloria-Soria was born in Mexico City and completed her undergraduate degree  in biology at the National University of Mexico.  She earned her Ph.D. at the University of Houston studying the ecological consequences of a behavioral polymorphism in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in the laboratory of Dr. Ricardo Azevedo.  She came to Yale University as a Gaylord Donnelley Environmental Postdoctoral Fellow from 2009-2011 to study genetic variation at a self-recognition locus in the cnidarian Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus.  She began working with mosquitos in Dr. Jeffrey Powell’s lab and transitioned to Associate Research Scientist in 2013.  In 2018, she joined The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station as an Assistant Agricultural Scientist and she remains affiliated to Yale as a laboratory scientist.  Her current work involves the study of genetic variation to understand 1) the historical and modern distribution patterns of arthropod vectors, 2) the implications of genetic variation and vector/virus interactions in disease transmission.  The lab is a few blocks away from Science Hill and on the Blue-shuttle bus line.  She is happy to discuss research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.

            <p>Anjelica has a dedicated interest in training the next generation of scientists to think interdisciplinary and approach problems form a scientifically global perspective.  With a multi-disciplinary approach, the Gonzalez lab combines organic chemistry, molecular biology, mathematics, computational modeling and image analysis to develop and use biomedically engineering scaffolds to dissect the chemo-mechanics of immunological processes.  This work has special significance to an array of diseases and disorders, including atherosclerosis, arthritis, diabetes, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and sepsis.</p><a href="mailto:anjelica.gonzalez@yale.edu">Email</a>

            <h3>Laura Morales</h3>
            <p>Laura Morales is a Ph.D. student in the Biomedical Engineering Department at Yale University. She graduated summa cum laude from the University of Miami (UM) in 2018 with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering. Her undergraduate research with Dr. Alice Tomei at the Diabetes Research Institute focused on characterizing polymeric biomaterials used in cell encapsulation and transplantation of islets of Langerhans in patients with advanced type 1 diabetes. During her time at UM, Laura was also an active member of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) chapter, where she served as treasurer during her senior year. In the Gonzalez Lab at Yale, Laura’s research focuses in understanding how neutrophils, the most abundant white blood cell in circulation, change as they cross the vascular wall and migrate to the site of inflammation. She utilizes biomaterials to engineer a composite microvasculature structure ex vivo, as well as several proteomics techniques. Outside of lab, Laura is co-president of the Graduate Society of Women Engineers at Yale, where she continues to work on stimulating URM to aspire and thrive as engineers and leaders in the community. In her spare time, she enjoys dancing ballet and salsa, cooking, and reading a good book. Laura is always happy to chat about anything and everything over a nice cup of Colombian coffee!</p><a href="mailto:laura.morales@yale.edu">Email</a>
