            <p>Andrea Gloria-Soria was born in Mexico City and completed her undergraduate degree  in biology at the National University of Mexico.  She earned her Ph.D. at the University of Houston studying the ecological consequences of a behavioral polymorphism in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in the laboratory of Dr. Ricardo Azevedo.  She came to Yale University as a Gaylord Donnelley Environmental Postdoctoral Fellow from 2009-2011 to study genetic variation at a self-recognition locus in the cnidarian Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus.  She began working with mosquitos in Dr. Jeffrey Powell’s lab and transitioned to Associate Research Scientist in 2013.  In 2018, she joined The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station as an Assistant Agricultural Scientist and she remains affiliated to Yale as a laboratory scientist.  Her current work involves the study of genetic variation to understand 1) the historical and modern distribution patterns of arthropod vectors, 2) the implications of genetic variation and vector/virus interactions in disease transmission.  The lab is a few blocks away from Science Hill and on the Blue-shuttle bus line.  She is happy to discuss research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.

            <p>Laura Morales is a Ph.D. student in the Biomedical Engineering Department at Yale University. She graduated summa cum laude from the University of Miami (UM) in 2018 with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering. Her undergraduate research with Dr. Alice Tomei at the Diabetes Research Institute focused on characterizing polymeric biomaterials used in cell encapsulation and transplantation of islets of Langerhans in patients with advanced type 1 diabetes. During her time at UM, Laura was also an active member of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) chapter, where she served as treasurer during her senior year. In the Gonzalez Lab at Yale, Laura’s research focuses in understanding how neutrophils, the most abundant white blood cell in circulation, change as they cross the vascular wall and migrate to the site of inflammation. She utilizes biomaterials to engineer a composite microvasculature structure ex vivo, as well as several proteomics techniques. Outside of lab, Laura is co-president of the Graduate Society of Women Engineers at Yale, where she continues to work on stimulating URM to aspire and thrive as engineers and leaders in the community. In her spare time, she enjoys dancing ballet and salsa, cooking, and reading a good book.
