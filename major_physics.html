          <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
          <p>Students typically pursue the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>PHYS170, 171 with MATH112, 115</li>
            <li>PHYS180, 181 with MATH115, 120</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>From Yale's syllabus: </p>
        <blockquote>
          B.S. degree program The prerequisites include an introductory lecture course sequence with a mathematics
          sequence
          equivalent to, or more advanced than, the corequisite of the physics sequence. The following options are
          appropriate:
          PHYS 170, 171 with MATH 112, 115; or PHYS 180, 181 with MATH 115, 120; or PHYS 200, 201 with MATH 120 and either
          222 or
          225; or PHYS 260, 261 with MATH 120, ENAS 151, PHYS 301, or MATH 230, 231 or equivalent. In addition, the
          laboratory
          sequence PHYS 205L, 206L or PHYS 165L, 166L is required. Students who take these physics and mathematics courses
          starting in their first year may satisfy the prerequisites by the middle of their sophomore year. Students who
          begin
          taking physics courses in their sophomore year may also complete either the standard or the intensive major.
          Students
          are advised to take mathematics courses throughout their first year at the appropriate level.

          <h3>Courses</h3>
          <p>
            Eight courses are required beyond the prerequisites, including the senior project. Students must take a
            mathematics
            course at the level of, or more advanced than, PHYS 301. Three courses at the core of the major, PHYS 401, 402,
            and PHYS
            439 or 440, involve advanced study of fundamental topics common to all branches of physics. PHYS 401 and 402
            pertain to
            advanced classical physics (mechanics, statistical physics and thermodynamics, and electromagnetism), while the
            third,
            PHYS 439 or 440 covers quantum mechanics. PHYS 401 must be taken before PHYS 402, 439, or 440.
            Three advanced elective courses are also required. Suitable advanced courses include the PHYS 340-level
            electives, an
            advanced laboratory such as PHYS 382L, and 400-level courses in Physics. Students may also find suitable
            advanced
            courses in other departments in the sciences, engineering, and mathematics. Courses taken to satisfy these
            requirements
            must be approved by the DUS. In order to pursue their individual interests in sufficient depth, many students
            choose to
            take more than the required number of advanced courses.
