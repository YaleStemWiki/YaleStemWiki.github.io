        +person("Stavroula Hatzios", "img/urm_faculty/hatzios.jpg", "Stavroula is an Assistant Professor of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology in the Microbial Sciences Institute at Yale University. A native of Blacksburg, Virginia, she received her B.S. in chemistry from MIT and conducted her graduate work with Carolyn Bertozzi at UC Berkeley. After earning her Ph.D., Stavroula completed a research fellowship in Uganda before pursuing postdoctoral work with Matt Waldor at Brigham and Women’s Hospital/Harvard Medical School. Outside of the lab, she has been a longtime volunteer with science outreach organizations and has performed widely as an oboist. Her lab studies proteins that shape host-microbe interactions in gastrointestinal infections.", "mailto:stavroula.hatzios@yale.edu")
        +person("Maia Baskerville", "./img/urm_faculty/maiab.png", "Maia is a third-year graduate student in the Department of Microbial Pathogenesis at Yale. She graduated summa cum laude from Wells College with a B.A. in biochemistry and molecular biology. As an undergraduate, Maia pursued viral genomics research with Dr. Keith Perry at Cornell University and studied viral regulation of immune cell differentiation with Dr. Gary Chan at SUNY Upstate Medical University. As a current student in the lab of Stavroula Hatzios on Yale West Campus, she is investigating the redox effects of Helicobacter pylori on host cells. Maia is also a deputy editor for the Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine (YJBM), and volunteers with the United Way of Greater New Haven and strives to close the \"town-gown\" divide in New Haven through science and non-science outreach. Outside her scientific pursuits, she enjoys playing the piano, creating art, cooking, and maintaining her patterned sock collection.", "mailto:maia.baskerville@yale.edu" )

      +person("Paul Turner", "img/urm_faculty/turner.jpg", "Paul Turner is the Rachel Carson Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Yale University, and faculty member in Microbiology at Yale School of Medicine. He studies the evolutionary genetics of viruses, particularly bacteriophages that specifically infect bacterial pathogens, and RNA viruses that are vector-transmitted by mosquitoes. Dr. Turner received a Biology degree (1988) from University of Rochester, and Ph.D. (1995) in Zoology from Michigan State University. He did postdoctoral training at National Institutes of Health, University of Valencia in Spain, and University of Maryland-College Park, before joining Yale’s Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department in 2001. His service to the profession includes Chair of the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) Division on Evolutionary and Genomic Microbiology, as well as membership on the National Science Foundation’s Biological Sciences Advisory Committee, ASM Committee on Minority Education, and multiple National Research Council advisory committees. Dr. Turner was elected Fellow of the National Academy of Sciences, Fellow of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences, Fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology, Councilor of the American Genetic Association, Chair of the Gordon Research Conference on Microbial Population Biology, and Chair of the CNRS Jacques Monod Conference on Viral Emergence. He chaired the Watkins Graduate Research Fellowship award committee for ASM, and received the E.E. Just Endowed Research Fellowship and William Townsend Porter Award from Marine Biological Laboratory, and fellowships from Woodrow Wilson Foundation, NSF, NIH and HHMI. Dr. Turner has served as Director of Graduate Studies and as Chair of the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department at Yale, as well as Yale’s Interim Dean of Science and Chair of the Biological Sciences Advisory and Tenure Promotion Committees.", "mailto:paul.turner@yale.edu")
      +person("Andrea Gloria-Soria". "img/urm_faculty/andrea_eeb.png", "Andrea Gloria-Soria was born in Mexico City and completed her undergraduate degree  in biology at the National University of Mexico.  She earned her Ph.D. at the University of Houston studying the ecological consequences of a behavioral polymorphism in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in the laboratory of Dr. Ricardo Azevedo.  She came to Yale University as a Gaylord Donnelley Environmental Postdoctoral Fellow from 2009-2011 to study genetic variation at a self-recognition locus in the cnidarian Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus.  She began working with mosquitos in Dr. Jeffrey Powell’s lab and transitioned to Associate Research Scientist in 2013.  In 2018, she joined The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station as an Assistant Agricultural Scientist and she remains affiliated to Yale as a laboratory scientist.  Her current work involves the study of genetic variation to understand 1) the historical and modern distribution patterns of arthropod vectors, 2) the implications of genetic variation and vector/virus interactions in disease transmission.  The lab is a few blocks away from Science Hill and on the Blue-shuttle bus line.  She is happy to discuss research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.
