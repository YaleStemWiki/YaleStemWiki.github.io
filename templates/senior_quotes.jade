  +person("Margo Feuer", "img/urm_faculty/margof.jpg", "Hi! My name is Margo Feuer, TC '20. I am a chemistry major, and have enjoyed my time in the department. Some reflections/advice: I started doing research as a sophomore, which worked out well for me! Especially if you can work in a lab that doesn't overwork you, starting early is a great way to get experience! Don't be afraid to switch labs if it's not working out at one! It's okay, you'll still graduate! Working with a female grad student was a good fit for me, perhaps that is something to arrange for you, too. Doing research in the summers is a good way to see if grad school is something you are interested in--its really different than working between classes during the semester. NSF-funded Research Experience for Undergraduates are a good place to look for all STEM-fields. Good luck!")
