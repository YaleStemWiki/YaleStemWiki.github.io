        h3 Prerequisites
        p Students typically pursue the following:
        ul
          li PHYS170, 171 with MATH112, 115
          li PHYS180, 181 with MATH115, 120
      p From Yale's syllabus: 
      blockquote
        | B.S. degree program The prerequisites include an introductory lecture course sequence with a mathematics
        | sequence
        | equivalent to, or more advanced than, the corequisite of the physics sequence. The following options are
        | appropriate:
        | PHYS 170, 171 with MATH 112, 115; or PHYS 180, 181 with MATH 115, 120; or PHYS 200, 201 with MATH 120 and either
        | 222 or
        | 225; or PHYS 260, 261 with MATH 120, ENAS 151, PHYS 301, or MATH 230, 231 or equivalent. In addition, the
        | laboratory
        | sequence PHYS 205L, 206L or PHYS 165L, 166L is required. Students who take these physics and mathematics courses
        | starting in their first year may satisfy the prerequisites by the middle of their sophomore year. Students who
        | begin
        | taking physics courses in their sophomore year may also complete either the standard or the intensive major.
        | Students
        | are advised to take mathematics courses throughout their first year at the appropriate level.

        h3 Courses
        p
          | Eight courses are required beyond the prerequisites, including the senior project. Students must take a
          | mathematics
          | course at the level of, or more advanced than, PHYS 301. Three courses at the core of the major, PHYS 401, 402,
          | and PHYS
          | 439 or 440, involve advanced study of fundamental topics common to all branches of physics. PHYS 401 and 402
          | pertain to
          | advanced classical physics (mechanics, statistical physics and thermodynamics, and electromagnetism), while the
          | third,
          | PHYS 439 or 440 covers quantum mechanics. PHYS 401 must be taken before PHYS 402, 439, or 440.
          | Three advanced elective courses are also required. Suitable advanced courses include the PHYS 340-level
          | electives, an
          | advanced laboratory such as PHYS 382L, and 400-level courses in Physics. Students may also find suitable
          | advanced
          | courses in other departments in the sciences, engineering, and mathematics. Courses taken to satisfy these
          | requirements
          | must be approved by the DUS. In order to pursue their individual interests in sufficient depth, many students
          | choose to
          | take more than the required number of advanced courses.
