            <p>Anjelica has a dedicated interest in training the next generation of scientists to think interdisciplinary and approach problems form a scientifically global perspective.  With a multi-disciplinary approach, the Gonzalez lab combines organic chemistry, molecular biology, mathematics, computational modeling and image analysis to develop and use biomedically engineering scaffolds to dissect the chemo-mechanics of immunological processes.  This work has special significance to an array of diseases and disorders, including atherosclerosis, arthritis, diabetes, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and sepsis.(Source: Faculty Page)</p><a href="mailto:anjelica.gonzalez@yale.edu">Email</a>
